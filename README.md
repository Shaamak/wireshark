# 🧪 Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

This project demonstrates how to capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark.

## 📌 Objectives

- Capture packets using Wireshark.
- Filter by protocol (DNS, HTTP, TCP).
- Identify at least 3 types of protocols.
- Document key observations and packet details.

## 🛠️ Steps Summary

1. Installed Wireshark on Linux/Windows.
2. Started capture on active network interface.
3. Browsed websites and pinged servers to generate traffic.
4. Stopped capture after ~1 minute.
5. Applied filters:
   - `http` – web traffic
   - `dns` – domain name lookups
   - `tcp` – connection management
